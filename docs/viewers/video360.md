# 360 Video Viewer

The 360 Video viewer renders a preview of a video stored as an equirectangular projection (often recorded with a special camera).

## Behavior

This viewer gives you an interactive view of the 360 degree video.

### Controls:
* Change the view direction with the left mouse button (single touch on touch-enabled device).

### VR button
When using a browser that supports WebVR and a suitable VR device is attached to your computer, a VR button will be available to allow toggling in and out of VR mode.

## Limitations

Currently, this previewer requires that the file be named with a '.360' preceeding the file extension. This is so that Preview SDK knows to run this previewer rather than the standard video preview.

## Supported File Extensions

`'360.3g2', '360.3gp', '360.avi', '360.m2v', '360.m2ts', '360.m4v', '360.mkv', '360.mov', '360.mp4', '360.mpeg', '360.mpg', '360.mts', '360.qt', '360.wmv'`
